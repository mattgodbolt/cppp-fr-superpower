# Notes

# Runthrough Nov 1st

<1h but had to compress. didn't get to end of things.

* Add thanks (to snellers, need to check how to attribute)
* Add RAII as a superpower
* "Clearer goals"
* Brain dump from tpurvele:
    - (Did you run any correctness checks (e.g. memory checkers/leaks etc) before and after and see an improvement?) You
      sort of answered.
    - Did you run any performance analysis to compare the before and after? (Especially given that you had an arena
      allocator before)
    - `[[gcc::attribute]]` instead of "`__attribute__`"?
    - You talked about constness but name/areaname etc are not const
    - The direct replacement of AREA linked list would have been std::forward_list.
    - Range UB?  http://www7.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG21/docs/papers/2020/p2012r0.pdf, see first example of table on
      first line.
    - capitalize: boost::string algos?
    - capitalize - if len == 0 -> exit
    - capitalize - use destructuring instead of first/second?
    - send_to - probably don't want std::forward in fmt example
    - train: name the lambda?
    - parsing - does it showcase C++ 17/modern C++?
* Be clear about the printf stuff - show `.c_str()` in places
    * make it clearer that `name` is a `std::string` on one slide
* Have I used UB (tpurvele notes above, need to check)?
    * are we relying on a range-based for loop UBism?
    * pretty sure am not, no references returned but it's subtle...
    * re-reading maybe we _are_ a problem?
```cpp
for (auto e : getTmp().getVals())
    // UB if getter returns reference
```
* DO A DEMO!!!!
* "Capitalize modern" <- not sure what that is
* Lyle points out there's two themes - how to move incrementally, and what new things we're adding. Maybe be more
  explicit if/when moving between sections
* What bugs were caught?
* Maybe start with strings?
* Super important super power from Rob D -> "means your code _will continue to work_ years after you wrote it"
* Parsing

## Runthrough Oct 31

* 4m backstory
* switch MUD and xania slides
* "do no harm" drop
* TODOs add more
* show version?
* after first simple fix need
    * build
    * run
    * manual test
* 20m to here
* What's next highlight
* 25m
* TODO on STL-i-f-cation on ptr stability
* 30m to class-i-fy slides
* Ranges...seems weak
* 50m to string formatting
* No joined up thinking about fmt (can't read my handwriting)
* fmt-> show variadic
* total 1h10

## Recent notes

What do I want folks to get from this talk?

* C++'s most criticised issues stem from backwards compatibility
    * Backwards compatibility is sometimes a real blessing
    * We can incrementally improve our codebases as standards evolve without ever breaking our apps and tools
    * Even as far back as 25 year-old-code
    * So, maybe cut C++ some slack, eh?
* Demonstrate some solid incremental change techniques
    * Testing, TDD
    * Refactoring in the genuine sense
* (also Matt is very human and is prepared to embarrass himself for some cheap laughs)

## Some kind of script?

* C++ super powers
* Before we talk about superpowers
* what things do we dislike?
* ... slide of them
    * https://twitter.com/mattgodbolt/status/1451997719367667714
        * Wrong defaults XXX
        * No standard package mgr XXX
            * Rich Felker "this is the best thing about it"
        * ABI compat XXX
        * "'70s design that is still all visible even in the latest versions"
        * "The syntax"
        * "Too big"
        * "UB"
        * "Implicit conversions"
        * "Based on C" https://twitter.com/richardmatthias/status/1452005934163759109?s=20
* What do I think C++'s super power is?
* All of these!
* "But Why Matt?!"
* Well, ok
* Backwards compatibility
* Whyso?
    * I can incrementally update my code as new things come in
    * C++11, C++14, I could opt in one part at a time inside the codebase
    * C++20 is quite a different language from C++98
        - show example
* Let me show you!
* I need some codebase to show this. Something I understand well, something that's open source, something that's been
  around a while.
* Let's bring it up to date to at least C++17, using new and cool features and libraries available.

----

* Xania! MUD from the mid-90s
* Backstory time, Exeter Uni, Physics, housemates and I played a lot of MUDs
* What is a MUD?
* We ran our own, got source, based on Diku/ROM, some code sharing with MadROM
* Ran until 2000s ish (check with Faramir)
* Found the source on an old hard disk
* C and some early C++
* Perfect!
* So! What does the code look like?!
* zomg pre-K&R C, and some C++
* DEMONSTRATE!
* What can we do to start cleaning it up?
* goals
    * make small changes
    * be able to keep running at each step
    * increase confidence nothing's broken as we go

----

* PREP WORK
* cmakify, git, wall extra rename
    * "What C isn't valid C++"
    * C/C++
    * `class`, `template`
* sanitizers
* Where to start?

----

* Memory management!
* Lots of strings copied all over the place!
* Let's start with a single field
* CRASH/etc - handle leaks/free() stuff
* sanitizers
* Leaving some noise, TODOs in the code, attributed, to come back to
    * things needing mutable strings? const char
* unique_ptr, gsl stuff?

----

* String formatting and manipulation
* fmt :allthethings:
* fmt and ranges
* intro testing here?

MORE NOTE FORM

* Section: strong types?
    * enum stuff
    * std array of things - all naked arrays gone
* Section: class-i-fication
    * collating functions
    * hiding members away
    * simplifying
    * testing!
* Section: unglobalisation (!)
* Conclusion!
* Some stats
* Reiterate goals
* THE FUTURE
    * C++20
    * fuzzing
    * epochs not a thing, but maybe there's a solution
    * BUT just remember not all languages get to do this!
